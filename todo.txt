- create generate file
- run gem5 simulations for general
- find saturation point
- run gem5 simulations for narrow
- get latency, throughput





- limited antennas, must be placed either (done)
	- randomly (all around or just layer 0)
		- can designate # of links per layer
	- user defined
		- add parameter similar to non uniform chiplet to routers with wireless links

- add new port in topology file (not completed)
	- wireless should be connected to all other wireless ones (fully-connected)
	- link must be variable bandwidth (new in garnet3.0)
		- set all variable bandwidth links to the same number (32)
	- routers with wireless should be different from other routers 
	- test variable bandwidth links
		- in 2D 3x3 topology, have some links be 32, others 4
		- what happens when the packet goes from 32 -> 4? Is the serdes used?
	- routers with wireless capabilities cannot be adjacent/have existing internal links (top, down, left, right, north, south)
	- closest wireless routers must be diagonal (checkerboard pattern)

- routing algorithm must change to incorporate wireless routing (in progress)
- compare number of hops between current and destination (wired VS wireless)
	- z value of current + z value of destination + difference in x + difference in y
	- distance to closest antenna from current + distance to closest antenna from dest
	- travel normally XYZ, check to see if current router has an antenna, and if it does, then do the calculation
